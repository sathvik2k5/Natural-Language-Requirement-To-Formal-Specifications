--- Requirement 5 ---
Natural Language: "The device will enter sleep mode, except before 5 minutes of inactivity or when the device is not idle."
Ground Truth Boolean Logic: SLEEP_MODE IF INACTIVITY_5MIN AND DEVICE_IDLE

LLM-generated Boolean Logic: DEVICE_IN_SLEEP_MODE

-> Here it completely ignored the part from except. Why is that? (Except sure is having many problems to fix (Prob cuz its NOT)).

--- Requirement 6 ---
Natural Language: "Notifications will not appear unless do not disturb mode is disabled and the phone is switched on."
Ground Truth Boolean Logic: NOTIFICATIONS UNLESS DND_MODE_ENABLED OR PHONE_OFF

LLM-generated Boolean Logic: NOT NOTIFICATION_APPEARS

-> This example was never correct LOL. Until now it was giving DOOR_OPEN for do not disturb. This time to probably got too 
   lazy and just gave Notifications will never appear heh.
