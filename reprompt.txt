Attempt 1:
Your prompt: 'Natural Language: "The system will install updates, except if there is not enough disk space or the update is not available."   for this natural language requirement, the LLM generated boolean logic was LLM-generated Boolean Logic: SYSTEM_INSTALLATION IMPLIES (NOT (NOT ENOUGH_DISK_SPACE OR UPDATE_AVAILABLE)) but here its wrong after IMPLIES it should install software when update IS available. so give me th new corrected boolean logic'
LLM response: I see what you mean!

The original LLM-generated Boolean Logic is indeed incorrect. Here's the corrected version:

LLM-Generated Boolean Logic: SYSTEM_INSTALLATION IMPLIES (UPDATE_AVAILABLE OR ENOUGH_DISK_SPACE)

In plain English, this means:

* If the system installation is possible, it will install updates...
	+ ...only if there is enough disk space AND an update is available.
	+ ...or only if there is not enough disk space (but no update is needed).

This corrected Boolean Logic reflects the correct natural language requirement: "The system will install updates, except if there is not enough disk space or the


Attempt 2:
Your prompt: 'Natural Language: "The system will install updates, except if there is not enough disk space or the update is not available." for this natural language requirement the LLM generated output is LLM-Generated Boolean Logic: SYSTEM_INSTALLATION IMPLIES (UPDATE_AVAILABLE OR ENOUGH_DISK_SPACE) but iboth updates should be available AND disk space should be enough for software installation'
LLM response: I see what's going on here!

The LLM-generated Boolean logic `SYSTEM_INSTALLATION IMPLIES (UPDATE_AVAILABLE OR ENOUGH_DISK_SPACE)` is indeed a correct representation of the natural language statement, but it's not entirely accurate. The issue is that the original statement implies both conditions must be true for software installation to occur.

To correctly represent this requirement in Boolean logic, we need to use the AND operator (`AND`) instead of the OR operator (`OR`). Here's the corrected LLM-generated Boolean logic:

`SYSTEM_INSTALLATION IMPLIES (UPDATE_AVAILABLE AND ENOUGH_DISK_SPACE)`

This logic states that system installation is

-> Here I had a problem with requirement 5 and 6 where I've been trying to explain but the LLM didnt understand my explanations so it
   needs a rather more specific reprompting. (the attempts are 7 and 3 because I lost patience abd gave up after trying
   those many attempts LOL.)
