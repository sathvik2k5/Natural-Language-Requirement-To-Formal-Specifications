--- Requirement 9 ---
Natural Language: "The settings will be saved, but only when the form is validated and the user has confirmed."
Ground Truth Boolean Logic: SETTINGS_SAVED IF FORM_VALIDATED AND USER_CONFIRMED

LLM Raw Output:
FORM_VALIDATED AND USER_CONFIRMED IMPLIES SETTINGS_SAVED

LLM-generated Boolean Logic: FORM_VALIDATED AND USER_CONFIRMED IMPLIES SETTINGS_SAVED

-> The LLM sometimes misunderstands the sentence and takes ONLY IF as IF.

--- Requirement 10 ---
Natural Language: "The connection will be established, but not without network availability."
Ground Truth Boolean Logic: CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED IF NETWORK_AVAILABLE AND CONNECTION_REQUESTED

LLM Raw Output:
CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED IMPLIES NETWORK_AVAILABILITY

LLM-generated Boolean Logic: CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED IMPLIES NETWORK_AVAILABILITY

-> But it understood this situation correctly. What's the reason?
