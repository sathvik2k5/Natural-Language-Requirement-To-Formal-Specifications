--- Requirement 1 ---
Natural Language: "The system will not install updates unless there is enough disk space and the update is available."
Ground Truth Boolean Logic: SOFTWARE_INSTALL UNLESS NOT ENOUGH_DISK_SPACE OR NOT UPDATE_AVAILABLE

LLM-generated Boolean Logic: SOFTWARE_INSTALLATION IMPLIES (NOT ENOUGH_DISK_SPACE OR UPDATE_AVAILABLE)

-> Here it added a NOT for Enough Disk Space. Why? (Or more like it didnt remove the not?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Requirement 2 ---
Natural Language: "The application will not launch unless the operating system is updated and the user is logged in."
Ground Truth Boolean Logic: APPLICATION_LAUNCH UNLESS NOT OPERATING_SYSTEM_UPDATED OR NOT USER_LOGGED_IN

LLM-generated Boolean Logic: LAUNCH_APP IMPLIES (OS_UPDATED AND USER_LOGGED_IN)

-> But it gave correct for this and the format is so similar to the previous one. So why is this correct? (IDKKKK)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Requirement 8 ---
Natural Language: "The system will not reboot unless all critical processes have completed and a reboot is requested."
Ground Truth Boolean Logic: SYSTEM_REBOOT UNLESS CRITICAL_PROCESSES_RUNNING OR NOT REBOOT_REQUESTED

LLM-generated Boolean Logic: SYSTEM_REBOOT IMPLIES (NOT SYSTEM_REBOOT OR ALL_CRITICAL_PROCESSES_COMPLETED)

-> Same as the first case. Btw in between we had many correct cases so unless is way better than except. (Pls don't use except
   whoever gives me the natural language specifications. Problem Solved.)
